Welcome to Run The Ropes, a wrestling database made for new and experienced wrestling fans alike! My goal is to make a readable site for people to see and learn all about wrestlers and professional wrestling in general! There are a lot of features I want to add in the future so please keep a look out for those.

Check out the deployed site for the Run The Ropes database here!: https://run-the-ropes-back-end.onrender.com/

Here are the endpoints you can hit!
1. For a list of all wrestlers: /wrestlers
2. For a specific wrestler: /wrestlers/{wrestlerid}
3. For the comments about a specific wrestler: /wrestlers/{wrestlerid}/comments
4. For a specific comment about a specific wrestler: /wrestlers/{wrestlerid}/comments/{commentid}

When entering a new wrestler into the database, you can must enter a name. Everything else is optional as some wrestlers may not have every piece of information online. The weight and height categories are numerical inputs ONLY.

That's all for now! Lace up your boots and enjoy the app!
